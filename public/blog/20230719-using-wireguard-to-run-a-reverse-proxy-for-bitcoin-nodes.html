This means that everytime your public IP address changes, your peers can not reach you anymore under your
previous IP address.
For them, it looks like you suddenly went offline. And for some reason, you don't get new inbound connections
after that.<p>You can confirm this by keeping track of your public IP (using <a href=https://ip.me/>ip.me</a> for example)
and check if all your inbound connections drop at the same time your public IP changes.
If that is the case, you can be pretty sure that your ISP changing your public IP is causing this.<p>So let's assume you have confirmed this and still want to run a bitcoin node at home with inbound
connections.<br>How do we fix this? As far as I know, you only have three options:<ul><li>Ask your ISP to assign you a static public IPv4 address (may require a business contract which costs more)<li>Restart your node everytime you notice that your public IP changed<li>Use a server with a static public IPv4 address as a reverse proxy</ul>As you might have guessed, I am going to show you how to use WireGuard to make a reverse proxy out of a server
of yours so you don't need to pay more
for your internet connection while learning more about networking at the same time.</div><div class="font-mono mt-1">WIP</div></div></div><footer class="flex text-center justify-center mx-1 pb-1"><div><hr><nav class="flex flex-row text-center justify-center"><a href=/rss.xml>rss</a>
