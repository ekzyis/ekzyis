    <strong>Using Wireguard to run a reverse proxy for bitcoin nodes</strong><br />

      If you a run a bitcoin node at home, you may have noticed that inbound connections drop after a while <a
        href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5428788">like I did</a>.<br />
      One likely reason could be that you were not assigned a static public IPv4 address from your ISP.
      This means that everytime your public IP address changes, your peers can not reach you anymore under your
      previous IP address.
      For them, it looks like you suddenly went offline. And for some reason, you don't get new inbound connections
      after that.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can confirm this by keeping track of your public IP (using <a href="https://ip.me/">ip.me</a> for example)
      and check if all your inbound connections drop at the same time your public IP changes.
      If that is the case, you can be pretty sure that your ISP changing your public IP is causing this.
    </p>
    <p>
      So let's assume you have confirmed this and still want to run a bitcoin node at home with inbound
      connections.<br />
      How do we fix this? As far as I know, you only have three options:
    <ul>
      <li>Ask your ISP to assign you a static public IPv4 address (may require a business contract which costs more)
      </li>
      <li>Restart your node everytime you notice that your public IP changed</li>
      <li>Use a server with a static public IPv4 address as a reverse proxy</li>
    </ul>
    As you might have guessed, I am going to show you how to use WireGuard to make a reverse proxy out of a server
    of yours so you don't need to pay more
    for your internet connection while learning more about networking at the same time.
