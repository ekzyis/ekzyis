<div class="font-mono mb-1">Welcome!</div>
<div>
  <p>
    I am just a pleb who likes programming, cybersecurity and bitcoin<br />
    (chronological order).
  </p>
  <p>
    I see this website as my personal playground where I can experiment with setups using minimal HTML and CSS (no
    javascript required here!),
    host a onion site, integrate protocols like
    <a href="https://docs.lightning.engineering/the-lightning-network/l402">L402</a> or
    <a href="https://nostr.com/">nostr</a> and whatever else I might come up with.
  </p>
  <p>
    While doing this, I want to share my experiences with others in blog posts for the following reasons:
  <ul>
    <li>They might be useful as guides if others want to do similar things</li>
    <li>Knowing that I can share whatever I learned with others later helps me stay motivated to keep learning more
    </li>
    <li>I would love to talk more about topics that I am interested in with people
      (<a href="https://stacker.news/">stacker.news</a> made me realize this!)
    </li>
    <li>I want to keep track of all the things I've learned over time</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
