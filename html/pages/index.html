<div class="font-mono mb-1 text-center">Welcome!</div>

  <p>
    I see this website as my personal playground where I can experiment with (web) technologies.<br />
    For example, I intend to host this site as a onion site and integrate protocols like
    <a href="https://docs.lightning.engineering/the-lightning-network/l402">L402</a> or
    <a href="https://nostr.com/">nostr</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also want to see with this site how far one can go with only static HTML and CSS; no Javascript and no external
    dependencies.
    The static HTML files are generated with
    <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/text/template">text/template</a>
    and deployed with
    <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/rsync">rsync</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, I want to share any knowledge gained in
    <a href="/blog">blog posts</a> for the following reasons:
  <ul>
    <li>They might be useful as guides if others want to do similar things</li>
    <li>
      Knowing that I can share whatever I learned with others later helps me stay motivated to keep learning more
    </li>
    <li>I want to keep track of all the things I've learned over time</li>
    <li>
      I would love to talk more about topics that I am interested in with people
      (<a href="https://stacker.news/">stacker.news</a> made me realize this!)
    </li>
    <li>
      Blogging is an obvious use case for a personal website and I want to be creative and write more
    </li>
  </ul>
